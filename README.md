# DiscordBot
My first discord bot :3

Yeah, this is my first discord bot, learning how to use libraries and mostly how to use JDA. I tried to make a discord bot using JS a long time ago and it didn't go very well, so I'm here now trying to make it in Java xD

> This bot isn't intended to be a public bot or whatever you may think, this is a bot for a specific server and I do not recommend you using it on your server.

## Features

`Register`
- Yeah, this bot has a simple register system for a single public server (will not work on other servers, you were advised about that).

`Swearing Command`
- If you run the command `.puta` the bot will grab a random swearing stored in my yml file and send it to you :)
###### Note that if you want to add a swearing to the list you can simply DM me and ask for it too.

TODO: `Countdown`
- I intend to make a countdown command in case you are a super weird person and wants a countdown from X to 0.
