#### <p align="center">My first discord bot :3

Yeah, this is my first Discord bot, learning how to use libraries and mostly how to use JDA. I tried to make a discord bot using JS a long time ago and it didn't go very well, so I'm here now trying to make it in Java xD

> **Note**

> This bot isn't intended to be a public bot or whatever you may think, this is a bot for a specific server.

> If you still want to use it on your server for some weird and dumb reason you can just grab the code and use it.

## Features

`Register`
- Yeah, this bot has a simple register system for a single public server (will not work on other servers, you were advised about that).

`Swearing Command`
- If you run the command `.puta`, the bot will grab a random swearing stored in my YAML file and send it to you :)
###### Note that if you want to add a swearing to the list you can simply DM me and ask for it as well.

`Countdown`
- You can run a countdown in case you are a weird person and want a countdown from X to 0.

`Misc`
- Yeah, this bot has many more features that I won't list here, but you can check them out by simply looking at the code.
