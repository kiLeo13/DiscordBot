#### <p align="center">My first discord bot

Yeah, this is my first Discord bot, learning how to use libraries and mostly how to use JDA. I tried to make a discord bot using JS a long time ago and it didn't go very well, so I'm here now trying to make it in Java xD

## Features

`Register`
- Yeah, this bot has a simple register system for a single public server (will not work on other servers, you were advised about that).

`Misc`
- Yeah, this bot has many more features that I won't list here, but you can check them out by simply looking at the code.
